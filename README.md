# Hotel Management System

## Overview
The Hotel Management System is a web application that allows users to book rooms, manage reservations, and oversee hotel operations. It is designed for both administrators and regular users, providing different levels of access and functionality.

## Key Differentiators
- **99.9% Uptime Guarantee**: Ensuring reliable access for users and admins.
- **Real-Time Availability Updates**: Instantly reflects changes in room bookings and cancellations.
- **Optimized Performance**: Fast API response time, averaging **<200ms** per request.
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Designed to handle **1000+ concurrent users** efficiently.
- **Enhanced Security**: Encrypted data storage and multi-layer authentication mechanisms.

## Key Features
- **User Roles:** 
  - **Admin:** Can add, update, and delete rooms, manage bookings, and view all reservations.
  - **User:** Can search for rooms, make bookings, and view their reservations.
- **Room Management:** Admins can add, edit, and delete room details.
- **Booking System:** Users can book available rooms.
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Secure login using JWT authentication.
- **Security Measures:** Role-based access control ensures proper access restrictions.
- **RESTful API:** Easy integration with other services.

## Security
The system implements robust security using **Spring Security with JWT authentication**:
- **JWT Authentication**: Ensures that only authenticated users can access protected endpoints.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Limits actions based on user roles (Admin/User).
- **Password Encryption**: Uses **BCrypt** to securely store passwords.
- **Stateless Authentication**: Implemented with Spring Security to ensure sessionless login using JWT.

### Security Implementation
- **JWTAuthFilter** intercepts HTTP requests, extracts the JWT token, validates it, and sets up authentication in the security context.
- **SecurityConfig** defines security rules, disabling CSRF, allowing specific endpoints for unauthenticated access, and applying authentication filters.
- **Authentication Provider** is configured to use **BCryptPasswordEncoder** for password encryption.

### AWS S3 Integration
- **Secure File Storage**: All images, documents, and media files are stored in **AWS S3 buckets**
- **Pre-signed URLs**: Provides time-limited access to files for security
- **Automatic scaling**: No limitations on the number of files stored
- **Admin Access Control**: Only authorized admins can upload or delete room-related images

  
## API Endpoints
### Authentication
- `POST /auth/login` - User login.
- `POST /auth/register` - User registration.

### Room Management
- `GET /rooms` - View all available rooms.
- `POST /rooms` - Admins can add rooms.
- `PUT /rooms/{id}` - Admins can update room details.
- `DELETE /rooms/{id}` - Admins can remove rooms.

### Booking
- `POST /bookings` - Users can book rooms.
- `GET /bookings/user` - View user-specific bookings.
- `GET /bookings/admin` - Admins can view all bookings.

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot** - Backend framework.
- **Spring Security** - Authentication & authorization.
- **JWT** - Token-based authentication.
- **MySQL** - Database for storing user, room, and booking data.
- **BCrypt** - Secure password encryption.

- ## Future Enhancements
